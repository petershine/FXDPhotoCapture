Without using any external sources, this pair uses only following iOS frameworks:
(Intentionally, left #import statement for easier copy and paste.)
#import <QuartzCore/QuartzCore.h>
#import <CoreMedia/CoreMedia.h>
#import <AVFoundation/AVFoundation.h>
#import <ImageIO/ImageIO.h>
#import <MobileCoreServices/MobileCoreServices.h>

In FXDinterfaceCapture, UIKit objects are also IBOutlets.
This way make the class to be usable with .nib of your choice

For unknown reason, UIViewController's own - (BOOL)shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:(UIInterfaceOrientation)toInterfaceOrientation; isnt' working correctly.
It's not being called when it's returning to be Portrait from other orientation.
So, I used UIDeviceOrientationDidChangeNotification instead, have it observed by CONTROL object.
